## Q64

<b>TLDR</b>:  
My competencies are in [drawing for curiosity](https://github.com/quinnliu/CV/blob/master/portfolio/artwork.md) & [coding AGI for trying to solve all hard problems](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut).

## LIFE PHILOSOPHY
One of my life philosophies is I try to live every 60 mins. as my last to prioritize what I should do in the present. If that ends up being too hard I go back to 3 hrs., 12 hrs., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, etc. 

Another life philosophy I adopted from Chris Wiggins is people > ideas > things. This means I have the weaknesses & strengths of many people that live in my subconscious including family, Harry Potter, Da Vinci, Darwin, Naruto, Steve Jobs, Casey Neistat, Maggie Q, Kong, Dileep George, Owen Cook & Derek, Richard Castle, Victor Frankl, Elon Musk, Einstein, Peter Thiel, Shane Parrish, Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Richard Feynman, & Patrick Jane. 

## WORK INTEREST
I want to solve the hardest problems at your startup using 101 mental models (inspired by Charlie Munger).

Currently looking for a full time leadership or full stack role at a startup that either involves large scale BMI, ANI, or miniature hardware(the smaller the better) based in NYC or full-time remote work. Open to other ideas you think I would be a good fit for :)

## COMMUNITIES
<b>[The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) dropout | Summer 2015</b>
- I think the Recurse Center is amazing for someone who wants to explore a field of CS but it's not good if you know exactly what you want to do. While at the Recurse Center I became very ignorant and began to think I knew exactly what I wanted to do mid semester. Because of this I lied about why I left the Recurse Center and I'm sorry to everyone I hurt by ghosting my class. This was the biggest lie I have intentionally told and now I'm focused on context aware radical honesty. 

<b>[hackNY Fellow](http://hackny.org/a/) | Summer 2014</b>
- Lived together with 25 other developers in the program & had a lecture series with founders of top NYC based tech companies including Joel Spolsky (Trello & stackoverflow), Jonah Peretti(HuffPo & Buzzfeed), Fred Wilson(USV), Zach Sims(codecademy), Ryan Bubinski(codecademy), etc. to learn the ins & outs of starting & leading a startup.

- Taught 20+ members through 2 hour/week workshops about the classical visual
  arts. Started the club with 2 friends also passionate about visual arts.
- Members with competence in other areas were also given the opportunity to present.
