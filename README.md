## Q Liu

<b>TLDR</b>:  
My competencies are in [drawing](https://github.com/quinnliu/resume/blob/master/portfolio/artwork.md) & [coding AGI](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut). Learning about relationships & physics.

My current life philosophy is I try to live every 12 hours as my last to prioritize what I should do in the present. Sometimes it is too hard for me so I go back to living every 24 hours as my last. If that ends up being too hard I go back to 1 week, then 1 month, then 6 months, etc. 

Another life philosophy I've recently adopted from Chris Wiggins is people > ideas > things. Some of the people that live in my subconscious are JZ(Mom), SL(Dad), Grandma & Grandpa, H & J(siblings), Harry Potter, Leonardo da Vinci, M.C. Escher, Charles Darwin, Hunter Smith(1st real friend), Myron Barnstone(Art mentor), Jeff Hawkins(AGI mentor), Uzimaki Naruto, Steve Jobs, Sal Khan, Casey Neistat(YouTube mentor), Maggie Q, K & J, Dileep George(AGI mentor), Scott Brown(AGI mentor), OC, Brian O'Kelley, Neil Gaiman, Jim Carry, Elon Musk, Einstein, Peter Thiel, Tim Urban, Ray Dalio, Charlie Munger, Jessica Chastain, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, RDJ, CE, MR, SJ, PB, SLJ, SM, etc.

## TECHNICAL PASSION PROJECTS
<b>[Open Source Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) Research](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut) | 2011 - Present</b>
- <b>TLDR:</b> I was wrong about how to build AGI 2 times since 2011 and now I'm learning how to increase human intelligence faster than code based intelligence. 

- In 2011 I watched [Jeff Hawkin's talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing) on 
artificial general intelligence(AGI) and I became obsessed with building AGI to help humanity. I taught myself how to code and built 
an OO Java implementation of [Numenta's cortial learning algorithm(CLA) v2](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_II). After running unsuccessful vision experiments using the CLA v2 I began to think there must be a better approach to building AGI. I found a better approach in Dileep George's [PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/Dileep_George_PGM/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf) and the project changed into an [OO Python implementation of his PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_III). While researching other approaches to AGI I came across [Elon Musk's perspective on AGI](https://youtu.be/h0962biiZa4)
and read [Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) with my notes [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/345) and realized I was completely wrong 
about building AGI to help humanity in the first place. Now the goal is to research how to increase human 
intelligence faster than code based intelligence.

## JOB EXPERIENCE
<b>Part Time assistant at [hackNY](http://hackny.org/a/) | Aug. 2017 - Present</b>
  
<b>Left AppNexus to travel with GF and work on passion projects full time | Sept. 2016 - Present</b>
- Lived in Berlin, Prague, Copenhagen, Virginia, & Texas

<b>Full time Business systems developer at [AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com/) | Summer 2015 - Sept. 2016</b>  
- From provided UI sketches co-developed with a senior software engineer 7 screens that used a 
  <b>RESTful API</b> to allow contracts with clients to be created, edited, cloned, and deleted. I learned a lot
  about UI from this mentorship. Used <b>redux</b> and <b>react.js</b>.
- Planned out and delivered a 1 month project to create new reports using <b>RESTful APIs</b> and a 
  <b>PHP UI codebase</b>.

<b>Business systems intern at AppNexus & [hackNY Fellow](http://hackny.org/a/) | Summer 2014</b>  
- Synchronized data across an internally built web app called Console and 
  Salesforce.com using technologies including RabbitMQ, Storm, PostgreSQL, 
  Gradle, Spock, JIRA, and Groovy ready for production.  

<b>TA for my favorite CS course at Virginia Tech Software Design & Data Structures | Spring 2014</b>  
- Taught 4 hour labs/week and held office hours on android development and Java.
 
<b>Full time researcher at Vision Lab at John Hopkins University Clark Hall | Summer 2013</b>  
- Optimized code for random walk image segmentation for iOS app iMixPics.
  [Paper](./portfolio/random_walker_image_segmentation_on_iOS_devices.pdf) &

  learning in visual pathway of human brain. [Poster](./portfolio/Scieneering_Poster_(5MB).jpg)
  
<b>Dish Washer, Sandwhich Maker, Salad Tosser, etc. at Virginia Tech West End for 75 hours | 2012 - 2013</b>
- During freshman year I took a non-credit engineering survey class and went to the 1st class to get to know more cute girls that studied engineering. Throughout the semester if I went to a class that ended up being boring I would swipe my student ID card at the beginning of class and then leave. Lucky for me the Dean of Engineering at VT realized this was happening and decided to also swipe all of the students at the end of class one day. Guess who was not in class & coding AGI? I went through a student trail and was given 75 hours of community service for premeditated skipping of class. I learned a lot from this experience becuase it forced me to realize what still needs to be fixed & provided me with a lot of time to think about how I want to live in the future. One of the lessons is don't chase cute girls. 

<b>Full time student at Classical Art Studio [barnstonestudios.com](barnstonestudios.com) | Summer 2010 & Summer 2011</b>
- [Visual Portfolio](https://github.com/quinnliu/resume/blob/master/portfolio/artwork.md) of drawing, designing, & painting 100+ hours/week for 10 weeks each summer.

<b>Co-founded Visual Art Club at Virginia Tech | 2011 â€“ 2013</b>  
- Started club with two friends also passionate about visual art. We organized weekly meetings where I presented my 
  knowledge on classical visual arts to 20+ members through 2 hour workshops. Members with competence
  in other areas were also given the opportunity to present.
  
<b>[The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) dropout | Summer 2015</b>
- I think the Recurse Center is amazing for someone who wants to explore a field of CS but it's not good if you know exactly what you want to do. While at the Recurse Center I was very ignorant and began to think I knew exactly what I wanted to do mid semester. Because of this I lied about why I left the Recurse Center and I'm sorry to everyone I hurt by ghosting my class. This was the biggest lie I have intentionally told and now I'm focused on context aware radical honesty. 
- FUN FACT: While at RC I also tried to convince George Bachman(CTO of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)) to pursue Numenta's CLA to build AGI which I now believe is not the best approach to AGI. Overall, I made a lot of mistakes while at RC. I'm sorry.
