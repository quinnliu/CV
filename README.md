## Q Liu

<b>TLDR</b>:  
My competencies are in [drawing](https://github.com/quinnliu/CV/blob/master/portfolio/artwork.md) & [coding AGI](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut). Learning about relationships & physics.

Currently looking for a full time manager/product/full stack or iOS software role in NYC at a startup that either involves large scale BMI, ANI, or miniature hardware(the smaller the better).

## FUN TECHNICAL PROJECTS
<b>[Open Source Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) Research](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut) | 2011 - Present</b>
- <b>TLDR:</b> I was wrong about how to build AGI 2 times since 2011 & now I'm learning how to increase human intelligence faster than code based intelligence.

- In 2011 I watched [Jeff Hawkin's talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing) on
artificial general intelligence(AGI) & I became obsessed with building AGI to help humanity. I taught myself how to code & built
an OO Java implementation of [Numenta's cortial learning algorithm(CLA) v2](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_II). After running unsuccessful vision experiments using the CLA v2 I began to think there must be a better approach to building AGI. I found a better approach in Dileep George's [PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/Dileep_George_PGM/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf) & the project changed into an [OO Python implementation of his PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_III). While researching other approaches to AGI I came across [Elon Musk's perspective on AGI](https://youtu.be/h0962biiZa4)
& read [Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) with my notes [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/345) & realized I was completely wrong
about building AGI to help humanity in the first place. Now the goal is to research how to increase human
intelligence faster than code based intelligence.

## COMMUNITIES
<b>[The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) dropout | Summer 2015</b>
- I think the Recurse Center is amazing for someone who wants to explore a field of CS but it's not good if you know exactly what you want to do. While at the Recurse Center I became very ignorant and began to think I knew exactly what I wanted to do mid semester. Because of this I lied about why I left the Recurse Center and I'm sorry to everyone I hurt by ghosting my class. This was the biggest lie I have intentionally told and now I'm focused on context aware radical honesty.

## Q Liu
One of my life philosophies is I try to live every 12 hours as my last to prioritize what I should do in the present. Sometimes it is too hard for me so I go back to living every 24 hours as my last. If that ends up being too hard I go back to 1 week, then 1 month, then 6 months, etc.

Another life philosophy I've recently adopted from Chris Wiggins is people > ideas > things. Some of the people that live in my subconscious are JZ(Mom), SL(Dad), Grandma & Grandpa, H & J(siblings), Harry Potter, Leonardo da Vinci, M.C. Escher, Charles Darwin, Hunter Smith(1st real friend), Myron Barnstone(Art mentor), Jeff Hawkins(AGI mentor), Uzimaki Naruto, Steve Jobs, Sal Khan, Casey Neistat(YouTube mentor), Maggie Q, K & J, Dileep George(AGI mentor), Scott Brown(AGI mentor), OC, Brian O'Kelley, Neil Gaiman, Jim Carry, Elon Musk, Einstein, Peter Thiel, Tim Urban, Ray Dalio, Charlie Munger, Jessica Chastain, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, RDJ, & Richard Feynman.
