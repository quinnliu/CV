## Q Liu

## SUMMARY 
As a kid I spent most of my time drawing everything I was curious about to eventually create a [visual portfolio](https://github.com/quinnliu/CV/blob/master/portfolio/artwork.md). My last big drawing was a partial human brain which inspired me to research the human brain by coding the first [open source AGI in 2011](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut). I majored in CS in college but was unhappy with the cost of higher CS education so I created [100+ non-clickbait YouTube videos on college level Math & CS that have grossed 6.6 million+ minutes watched](https://www.youtube.com/user/quinnliuvideos). In college I finished 10+ online CS & Machine Learning courses & worked in vision & neuroscience labs at John Hopkins & Virginia Tech. During & after college I loved learning how to be a founder at hackNY & full stack engineer at AppNexus. Although I <3 NYC I wanted to travel the world so I left AppNexus to become a remote coding tutor and travel Europe. I believe inexpensive quality higher education is still a unsolved problem so I founded www.infinity2o.com with my brother.
